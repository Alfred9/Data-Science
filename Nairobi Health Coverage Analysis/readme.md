# Healthcare Accessibility in Nairobi, Kenya: A Data-Driven Analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook project explores the healthcare accessibility challenges within Nairobi, Kenya. Through a comprehensive analysis of healthcare facilities, services, and demographic data, this study highlights the disparities in access and quality of healthcare services across different areas of the city. The analysis aims to offer targeted recommendations in alignment with **Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3)**, which seeks to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all.

## Key Issues Addressed
Despite Nairobi being the political and economic hub of Kenya, significant healthcare challenges persist:
- **Uneven Distribution of Healthcare Resources**: Some areas have advanced facilities, while others lack basic healthcare infrastructure.
- **Socio-Economic Barriers**: High poverty and unemployment rates hinder access to healthcare and transportation.
- **Urbanization Pressures**: Rapid population growth outpaces the expansion of healthcare services, leading to overcrowded hospitals.
- **Demographic Disparities**: Vulnerable groups, such as women, children, and the elderly, face unique healthcare challenges, including limited maternal and reproductive care services.

## Project Objectives
This project aims to provide insights into healthcare accessibility issues in Nairobi by exploring several hypotheses:
1. **Healthcare Facility Distribution**:
   - What is the distribution of healthcare facilities across Nairobi's sub-counties?
   - Are there underserved areas with insufficient healthcare services?
   
2. **Facility Type and Ownership**:
   - What is the breakdown of healthcare facilities by type (e.g., dispensary, clinic) and ownership (e.g., Ministry of Health, private practice)?
   
3. **Capacity and Service Provision**:
   - What is the capacity of these facilities (in terms of beds, cots, etc.) and are there gaps in specific services?

4. **Operational Status and Accessibility**:
   - What is the current operational status of facilities, and how does this impact healthcare access?

5. **Demographic Disparities**:
   - How does population density and other demographic factors influence healthcare access and utilization?

## Data Sources
This analysis relies on healthcare facility datasets, demographic information, and additional socio-economic data from various sources to provide a detailed overview of Nairobi's healthcare landscape.

## Analysis and Findings
The investigation explores:
- Geographic disparities in healthcare access across sub-counties.
- The relationship between healthcare facility ownership, capacity, and operational status.
- The impact of socio-economic and demographic factors on healthcare utilization.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, targeted recommendations will be formulated to:
- Improve resource allocation for underserved areas.
- Enhance healthcare service delivery to meet the needs of vulnerable populations.
- Support policymakers in addressing healthcare accessibility gaps in Nairobi, aligned with SDG 3.
